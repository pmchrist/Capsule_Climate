Initial calibration seems to take a lot of time.
    Todo: Code needs restructuring and more details.

    Should we calibrate before each addition? Or only once parameters are added. For example Social parameter.
    What is the general workflow?

    1)  Add environmental awareness/opinion score into HH
        Add environmental punishment into the Consumermarket process
        Run tests
    2)  Add these scores to CP and KP (not sure if viable, check structure of original model)
